# What is this all about?
Too many opportunities for process automation are missed as they're deemed too expensive to consider or time consuming to complete.  

In many cases process improvement is attempted but only serves to push the bottleneck somewhere else. For example, digitising a paper form is a great start, but not if it results in the team manually processing greater numbers of electronic forms than there were paper forms in the first place. The total process lifecycle has to be considered.

Salesforce technology options are varied and this serves to get the community to a good starting point for conversation and action.
